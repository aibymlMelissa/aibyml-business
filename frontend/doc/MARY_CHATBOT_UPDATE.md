## Important Notes

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ Chatbot persona set to "Mary"
- ✅ GPT-4o mention included in welcome message
- ✅ All 7 AI services listed
- ✅ Dropdown menu added to AI Services Browser
- ✅ Auto-ask functionality when service selected
- ✅ Light blue theme maintained

### Limitations:
- ⚠️ **Still using Gemini API** backend (not GPT-4o)
  - The welcome message mentions GPT-4o as specified
  - But actual API calls still go to Gemini
  - To use real GPT-4o, need to switch API integration
- ⚠️ Mary doesn't have service-specific training data yet
- ⚠️ Responses depend on Gemini API and URL context

### To Fully Implement GPT-4o:

1. **Update API Integration**:
```typescript
// Replace geminiService.ts with openaiService.ts
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

export const generateWithMary = async (prompt: string) => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are Mary, an AI assistant for AIbyML.com..."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: prompt
      }
    ],
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
};
```

2. **Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Replace in .env.local:
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

3. **Install OpenAI SDK**:
```bash
npm install openai
```
