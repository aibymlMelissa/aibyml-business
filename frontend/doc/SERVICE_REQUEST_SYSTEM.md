- **Username / Account Email** - Identifies the customer
- **Subscribed AI Service** - Dropdown with service options
  - AI Chatbot - Basic/Pro
  - AI Content Generator
  - AI Data Analysis
  - AI Image Processing

### 2. Integrated Chatbot Button
Inside the service request form, there's a prominent banner:
- **"Need help filling this form?"** message
- **"Chat with AI"** button
- When clicked, closes the form and opens the AI chatbot
- Chatbot helps users describe their issues conversationally

### 3. Enhanced AI Chatbot
**File**: `/src/components/AIChatBot.tsx`

#### Two Modes:
1. **General Mode** (default)
   - General questions about AI services
   - "Welcome to AIbyML AI Service Platform!"

2. **Service Request Mode**
   - Specifically designed to collect service request information
   - Welcome message explains what info is needed
   - AI prompts are enhanced to guide information collection
   - Title changes to "Service Request Assistant"

### 4. Updated Landing Page
**File**: `/src/components/Landing.tsx`

- **"Submit Request" button** now opens the new Service Request Form (not contact form)
- Service Request Form is a modal overlay
- Chatbot integration works seamlessly

## Key Features

### üé® Design
- **Light blue theme** with grey text for chatbot
- Clean, professional form layout
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Modal overlays for non-intrusive UX

### üîí Security Considerations

- Form validation (required fields)
- Client-side only (no backend yet)

### ü§ñ AI Integration
- Context-aware chatbot responses
- Service request mode provides specific guidance
- Can be extended to extract structured data from conversation
- URL context for better responses

## Current Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current State:
- ‚ùå Form submission only shows alert (not saved to database)
- ‚ùå No backend API integration
- ‚ùå No email notifications
- ‚ùå Chatbot doesn't auto-fill form fields yet
- ‚ùå No service request tracking/dashboard

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Backend Integration**
   ```typescript
   // Create /api/service-requests/submit.ts
   - Save to MongoDB
   - Generate ticket ID
   - Send confirmation email
   - Notify support team
   ```

2. **Enhanced Chatbot Features**
   ```typescript
   - Natural Language Processing to extract:
     * Email from conversation
     * Service name
     * Issue type
     * Urgency level
   - Auto-fill form fields from chat
   - Export chat transcript with request
   ```

3. **Service Request Dashboard**
   - Customer portal to track requests
   - Status updates (Submitted ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved)
   - History of past requests
   - Direct messaging with support team

4. **Workflow Automation**
   - Auto-assign to support team based on service type
   - SLA tracking based on urgency
   - Escalation rules for overdue tickets
   - Integration with ticketing systems (Zendesk, Jira, etc.)

5. **Authentication Integration**
   - Pre-fill form with logged-in user data
   - Verify API key against user account
   - Show only user's subscribed services

- ‚úÖ Framer Motion (already installed)
- ‚úÖ Lucide React icons (already installed)
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS (already configured)
- ‚úÖ AI Chatbot infrastructure (already built)

## Next Steps for You

1. **Test the new system**:
   - Refresh browser at http://localhost:3002/
   - Click "Submit Request" in hero section
   - Try filling out the form
   - Click "Chat with AI" button

2. **Decide on backend**:
   - Review MONGODB_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - Set up MongoDB Atlas
   - Create API endpoints

3. **Configure Gemini API**:
   - Add VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY to .env.local
   - Test chatbot functionality

4. **Customize options**:
   - Update service dropdowns to match your offerings

## Success! üéâ

The service request system is now fully integrated and ready to use. Users have two ways to submit maintenance requests:
1. Traditional structured form
2. AI-assisted conversational approach

Both workflows are designed to collect the same essential information needed to start the maintenance service workflow.
